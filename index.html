    <p>Changelog:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Version 0.2.4:
            <ul>
                <li>2018-01-05: There should in theory be a favicon for the game now.</li>
                <li>2018-01-05: Shrapnel towers now have a blood icon.</li>
                <li>2018-01-05: Saves now trigger when an enemy hits the edge of the map.</li>
                <li>2018-01-05: Saves now store a backup locally when triggered although currently there isn't a way to access this backup save through the UI.</li>
                <li>2018-01-05: Closing the options menu now triggers a save (so it will remember volume settings on reload without having to kill a wave).</li>
                <li>2018-01-02: Added a constraint solving engine called csp.js by PrajitR to assist in efficiently calculating map changes.</li>
                <li>2017-12-30: The game now uses a new tileset by Leonard Pabin. Over time the walking tiles will shift from grass to desert as an aesthetic effect, note that these changes will be lost on reload.</li>
                <li>2017-12-30: You now start with two blocks, one in the center as usual and another closer to the default pathing at the start of the game.</li>
                <li>2017-12-29: Added a display of the current playing song to options, you all can let me know which tracks you like/dislike.</li>
                <li>2017-12-28: Added in a background sounds checkbox to options, by default sounds will not play in the background.</li>
                <li>2017-12-28: Added in a master volume control that impacts both special effects sounds and music.</li>
                <li>2017-12-28: Added in music with it's own volume control.</li>
                <li>2017-12-28: There is now a sound effect when you learn a skill. There is now an options screen where you can control the sound effect volume, including turning it to 0.</li>
                <li>2017-12-28: Shrapnel ammo now respects effects that reduce damage, like armored and shielded. The amount of bleeding done is now based on how much direct kinetic damage was done.</li>
                <li>2017-12-28: Save games are now compressed. A save that would've previously taken about 43k characters now takes 12k characters. There's definitely room for improvement but this should be a solid start.</li>


            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Version 0.2.3:
            <ul>
                <li>2017-12-26: Prestige points are now awarded at a curve starting at 1 instead of 4. In addition to encourage deep runs there is an overall multiplier added every 100 waves. E.g. 2x prestige at Wave 201 and above, 3x prestige at 301 and above.</li>
                <li>2017-12-26: Fixed a bug with the previous wave button that decremented two waves instead of one when in farm mode (Github Issue #8). Thanks desci!</li>
                <li>2017-12-26: Clicking a button or keybind for a tower will now clear the cursor if you do not have a sufficient amount of gold for that type of tower (Github Issue #8). Thanks desci!</li>
                <li>2017-12-26: There are now white level indicators overlayed on all towers.</li>
                <li>2017-12-26: Added Market Connections as a new secondary skill under investment.</li>
                <li>2017-12-26: Added a new starting skill and branch called Investment.</li>
                <li>2017-12-26: As part of rebalancing skill times anti-coagulants was massively reduced in skill points cost. The effect has been reduced accordingly from 5% / rank to 1.25% / rank. Meaning that it now requires level 20 to halt bleeding reduction instead of rank 10, however the skill point cost has been massively reduced.</li>
                <li>2017-12-21: Fixed a bug preventing stored skill points from being applied to new skill training.</li>
                <li>2017-12-21: Related to the entry below, added the ability for ammo types to have their own bullet sprites.</li>
                <li>2017-12-21: Added Arcane icon for Arcane Orb ammo on magic towers.</li>
                <li>2017-12-21: Upgraded Phaser.js to 2.9.4 (community edition).</li>
                <li>2017-08-20: Changed the mana regeneration display to prettify in the numbers.</li>
                <li>2017-08-20: Implemented the arcane orb ammo type which grants +1 mana on hit and causes arcane damage.</li>
                <li>2017-04-29: Upgraded Knockout.js to 3.4.2, BigNumber.js
                    to 4.0, EasyStar.js to 0.4.1, jsTree to 3.3.3, and moment.js to 2.17.1.
                </li>
                <li>2017-03-20: It is now possible to not be actively learning a skill, doing so accrues skillpoints which can then be spent on a skill.</li>
                <li>2017-03-11: The bug where nullzoned enemies were leaving behind their nullzones appears to be
                    quashed.
                </li>

                <li>2017-02-05: Along with the previous change the elemental rune reaction system has been folded
                    into ammo types. Previously runes had a chance every second to proc their reaction which was
                    subject entirely to RNG. Now there are elemental catalyst ammo types which consume the given
                    type of elemental rune and cause that reaction.
                </li>
                <li>2017-01-17: Fire, earth, water, air towers collapsed into elemental towers, previously gained
                    blueprint points should be converted to the new towers.
                </li>
                <li>2017-01-14: Significant nerf to prestige. Rather than each point granting 10% increase to learn
                    rate each point grants 1% and is subjected to diminishing returns after 100% increase. This was
                    done because these large linear increases meant that after the first prestige, usually
                    regardless of when you prestiged, all non-infinite skill costs become negligable. This also
                    encourages deeper runs to counter-act the diminishing returns. To account for this nearly all
                    skills will be adjusted down, including the scaling of infinite skills.
                </li>

                <li>2017-01-08: Tweaked tooltips to increase the buffer between the mouse and actual tooltip and
                    cancel the tooltip if you mouse over the tooltip to prevent tooltips from blocking buttons.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Version 0.2.2:
            <ul>
                <li>2017-01-02: For the ammo change below the shrapnel ammo skill has been replaced with a 1 rank
                    skill that simply grants the ammo type.
                </li>
                <li>2017-01-02: Upgraded jQuery-UI (for dialogs) to 1.12.1.</li>
                <li>2017-01-02: Added a grey box which describes a tower including its general description, support
                    function if it has one, and ammo if it has it. This replaces the very small support tower
                    description that existed before.
                </li>
                <li>2016-12-26: Added an ammo system (currently only for kinetic towers). This allows one tower to
                    have different modes. Currently there is only regular bullets and shrapnel rounds (which are
                    learned) for kinetic towers.
                </li>
                <li>2016-12-17: Finally squashed the IE11/Edge memory leak bug. Apparently the canvas renderer will
                    not leak in IE but WebGL will.
                </li>
                <li>2016-12-14: The tooltip library previously being used (qTip) does not support jQuery 3.x so I
                    have removed it and rewritten tooltips without the library or jQuery.
                </li>
                <li>2016-12-14: Upgraded jQuery to the 3.x branch. Phaser itself does not support IE8 so this
                    shouldn't change the compatibility for the game overall
                </li>
                <li>2016-12-10: Upgraded Knockout.js to 3.4.1</li>
                <li>2016-12-02: Added a flat skill mode which allows you to view only skills that you can place
                    points in without the extra hierarchy information.
                </li>
                <li>2016-12-02: Fixed bug where stars weren't showing on infinite skills for every 20 ranks.</li>
                <li>2016-11-28: Added Proton theme to skills dialog to hopefully make it much clearer if a skill
                    item can be expandable or not.
                </li>
                <li>2016-11-20: Placing a block or selling a block now shows what the new path would look like, if
                    performing that action would change the path.
                </li>


            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Version 0.2.1:
            <ul>
                <li>2016-11-20: Fixed a bug where sensor towers placed on the edge of the map would cause
                    errors/freezing.
                </li>
                <li>2016-11-20: Fixed an issue which caused all save game loads to quit working.</li>
                <li>2016-11-20: Changed google font load to HTTPS to avoid mixed content warnings.</li>
                <li>2016-09-04: Added a 'fast forward' button to return to the highest wave you've ever witnessed.
                </li>
                <li>2016-09-04: Revised the previous/pause/play buttons into symbols to save space and added
                    tooltips
                    for each.
                </li>
                <li>2016-09-04: Reduced the scaling on nullzone. Now grants 1 space of dampening at rank 1 and an
                    additional 0.5 per rank after that.
                </li>
                <li>2016-07-18: Added generic adjectives and nouns for wave titles and implemented random colors for
                    their announcement.
                </li>
                <li>2016-07-10: Added power adjectives and an alternate styling to wave titles.</li>
                <li>2016-07-06: Each wave is now introduced with a title generated based on the pack that's
                    coming.
                </li>
                <li>2016-06-22: Added 6 new sprites (red wizard, black wizard, black golem, blue golem, flying
                    skull,
                    turtle).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Version 0.2:
            <ul>
                <li>2016-06-20: Added versions. I've declared all changes that have been live for the past month and
                    a
                    half version 0.1, and I dub this version 0.2. The version number now shows next to the title of
                    the
                    game.
                </li>
                <li>2016-06-20: Linked the header and a new button to Reddit. I'm hoping to build up a community
                    there.
                    Maybe potentially replacing the woefully inadequate help feature with a reddit wiki.
                </li>

                <li>2016-06-20: Added code to stop mixtures of certain boss powers from occuring. For example Fast
                    and Heavy don't make sense together, neither do Heavy and Flying.
                </li>

                <li>2016-06-20: Updated the teleport tooltip to explain the nerf that had already been made to it
                    (won't teleport past the furthest enemy).
                </li>

                <li>2016-06-20: Enemies with the flight power are now more susceptable to the knock back caused by
                    wind towers (they stay in the air longer). They also have 40% reduced max health. Updated the
                    tool tip to reflect this.
                </li>
                <li>2016-06-16: Reworked movement code to be much simpler and allow for diagnal movements for the
                    newly
                    implemented flight power. Flight allows enemies to move diagnally and over all blocks and
                    towers.
                </li>
                <li>2016-06-16: Removed the path finder plugin. I needed to use a feature of easystar that was not
                    exposed by it
                    and it wasn't much code to replace it.
                </li>
                <li>2016-06-12: Seismic Rupture spell has been added, now each element has at least one spell.
                    Hooray!
                </li>
                <li>2016-06-11: Preferred powers can be equal to other powers (it's just guaranteed that if they are
                    not maxed
                    out that no other power is greater than them), now they are displayed first in the listing
                    regardless of
                    strength so you can see at a glance what the preferred power of a sprite is.
                </li>
                <li>2016-06-11: Added cow enemy and a new boss power called 'heavy' which slows base movement speed
                    but makes
                    the enemy immune to knockbacks and slows (except for total frozen).
                </li>
                <li>2016-06-10: All rune-addition now runes through the same set of diminishing returns. The chance
                    of applying
                    the rune is reduced by the number of runes of that type already on the target, whether that
                    target recently
                    experienced an elemental reaction of that type, and whether the target is resistant to that type
                    (which is
                    the same as before). This change includes spells.
                </li>
                <li>2016-06-09: "Normal" (non boss) waves now have boss powers starting at level 25, they will have
                    half the
                    number of boss power slots as the boss levels do.
                </li>
                <li>2016-06-09: Added the armored power which reduces kinetic (normal tower etc.) damage.</li>
                <li>2016-06-08: Fixed an issue where elemental resistance skills (fire/water/air/earth/arcane) were
                    errantly
                    allowed to roll on bosses without the relevant skills learned, making the boss fights much
                    easier.
                </li>
                <li>2016-06-08: When sprites are randomly selected they will be rerolled if their preferred power
                    shouldn't be
                    selected (fire-resistant shouldn't roll if the player doesn't have fire affinity for example).
                </li>
                <li>2016-06-08: Added two new beetle sprites with water-resistant and fire-resistant preferred
                    powers.
                </li>
                <li>2016-06-08: A new boss power has been added. Nullzone stops towers within a certain number of
                    spaces from
                    firing. The newly added sensor array is meant to be the counter to this power.
                </li>
                <li>2016-06-01: Selecting a support tower (currently just sensor arrays) will present a blue tooltip
                    that
                    explains what exactly it does.
                </li>
                <li>2016-06-01: Selecting a tower that is under a buff from the sensor array will now show the types
                    and degree
                    or buffs it is currently under.
                </li>
                <li>2016-06-01: Added sensor arrays, currently they buff adjacent (including diagnal) non-support
                    towers by
                    granting them a bonus 15% range for 2 seconds when they "fire".
                </li>
                <li>2016-05-28: All elemental effects should now properly trigger diminishing returns on all enemies
                    hit, not
                    just the one that started the reaction.
                </li>
                <li>2016-05-23: Boss generation is now more likely to favor fewer, stronger powers (although the
                    'preferred'
                    power tied to that enemy type is always guaranteed to be the strongest or tied for strongest).
                </li>
                <li>2016-05-22: The teleport boss power now causes the enemy pack to be at least two units.</li>
                <li>2016-05-22: Each type of enemy now has a boss power associated with it.</li>
                <li>2016-05-21: There is now a help file available for prestige upon reaching level 100.</li>
                <li>2016-05-21: Tooltips now fully destroy themselves upon being hidden.</li>
                <li>2016-05-21: Upgrade tooltips will now dynamically update if the skill has upgraded while the
                    tooltip was
                    opened.
                </li>
                <li>2016-05-19: Abandoned web worker implementation of inactive timer, using setInterval instead.
                </li>
                <li>2016-05-19: Implemented pause/resume buttons, moved it to its own row next to the previous wave
                    button.
                </li>
                <li>2016-05-19: The nerf hammer has visited teleport, now teleport can only go as far as one tile
                    further than
                    the farthest enemy. If there is only one enemy then it will only be able to teleport one space
                    at a time
                    regardless of how strong its teleport power is.
                </li>
                <li>2016-05-19: Super huge refactoring, broke down a large monolithic chunk of code into 18
                    modules.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Version 0.1:
            <ul>
                <li>2016-05-05: Added RequireJS.</li>
                <li>2016-05-05: I'm declaring the IE11 Memory Leak solved, although there appears to be a bug with
                    IE
                    development tools that will cause a memory leak if you use the memory profiler.
                </li>
                <li>2016-05-04: Upgraded jstree to 3.3.0.</li>
                <li>2016-05-04: Upgraded jQuery to 1.12.3.</li>
                <li>2016-05-03: Upgraded KnockoutJS to 3.4.0.</li>
                <li>2016-04-29: Upgraded Phaser to 2.4.7.</li>
                <li>2016-04-29: Found another issue with timing which should be fixed now. Now uses
                    performance.now() if
                    the browser supports it but falls back to Date.now() otherwise.
                </li>
                <li>2016-04-29: Renamed Fire Rate to Attack Delay.</li>
                <li>2016-04-29: Hopefully also fixed a subtle timing issue that may have caused towers to fire at
                    the
                    same time despite having different rates and may have also been involved with the bug some were
                    experiencing where upgrade all would stop towers from firing.
                </li>
                <li>2016-04-28: Hopefully addressed issue with upgrade all being slow. In my tests the new upgrade
                    all
                    will upgrade 60 level 1 kinetic towers to level 1095 in 200ms, as opposed to the ~50-100s it
                    would've taken before.
                </li>
                <li>2016-04-26: Mana Burst was erroneously granting a chance to increase mana pool at high levels of
                    mana. Now you must cast it at 1/3rd mana for this to occur, the chance scales from 5% at 1/3rd
                    mana to 100% at close to 0 mana. To compensate for this I have changed mana burst to grant its
                    additional damage when your mana pool is over 90% full instead of having to be at full mana. The
                    description has been updated to describe all of these changes.
                </li>
                <li>2016-04-26: You can no longer sell your last tower or template scrap your last tower.</li>
                <li>2016-04-26: Refreshing will no longer grant old towers the benefits of Initial Engineering.</li>
                <li>2016-04-26: Escape key will first cancel an action, but if there is no action selected it will
                    de-select any selected tower/enemy.
                </li>
                <li>2016-04-26: Removed text that tells the player to press shift to continue the same action, since
                    actions now repeat by default.
                </li>
                <li>2016-04-26: Fixed an issue where the blueprint action was allowed after prestige without the
                    appropriate skill.
                </li>
                <li>2016-04-25: Fixed issue where selling blocks returned more gold than they cost to buy.</li>
                <li>2016-04-25: Fixed issue with prestige not reseting blueprint counts, causing towers to be
                    unaffordable.
                </li>
                <li>2016-04-16: Learning tower templates is now a one rank skill which unlocks the
                    blueprinting/templating action. This action scraps a tower in exchange for blueprint points of
                    that
                    tower type. Each blueprint point increases the starting damage of towers of that type by 1 and
                    gold
                    cost by 5.
                </li>
                <li>2016-04-16: There is now a new category of actions called... actions. Currently only tower
                    templates
                    uses this.
                </li>
                <li>2016-04-16: Added hover indicators with text for most actions (except spells), these indicators
                    also
                    show where its valid to perform an action.
                </li>
                <li>2016-03-31: Added Arcane Knowledge skill which gives another method to increase max mana outside
                    of
                    using mana burst.
                </li>
                <li>2016-03-29: The ban hammer had to be made slightly stronger. Saves will no longer respect insane
                    range or attack speed values, it will treat them as if you built a new tower instead.
                </li>
                <li>2016-03-27: Added a visual indicator for relative tower power per type.</li>
                <li>2016-03-26: The ban hammer has arrived: Upgrading towers no longer reduces fire rate nor does it
                    increase range.
                </li>
                <li>2016-03-26: Help system now shows unread messages in the help button instead of popping up a
                    dialog
                    box each time a new topic is discovered.
                </li>
                <li>2016-03-23: Wrote a skills help file in the new system that explains the rank up that occurs
                    every
                    20 ranks of non-maxable skills.
                </li>
                <li>2016-03-23: Migrated the help popups to a new help system, the main difference is now you can go
                    back and read popups that had come up in the past by clicking the 'Help' button.
                </li>
                <li>2016-03-21: Skill descriptions now show the list of skills granted at certain ranks.</li>
                <li>2016-03-21: Implemented Mana Regeneration (Advanced) which increases mana regeneration as a
                    percentage.
                </li>
                <li>2016-03-21: Actions now repeat automatically until canceled instead of requiring a modifier key.
                </li>
                <li>2016-03-21: Actions now clear the cursor if they would've created the same type of cursor (this
                    allows keybind double-tap to cancel).
                </li>
                <li>2016-03-20: The path no longer recalculates at the start of a wave.</li>
                <li>2016-03-20: Unbound the 'a' key from upgrade all. It now requires a click.</li>
                <li>2016-03-19: Upgrade using all gold now performs upgrades in batches (currently 20 a frame)
                    instead
                    of doing all of them at once which was causing freezing.
                </li>
                <li>2016-03-18: Fixed an issue where previously existing towers weren't being cleaned up on load.
                </li>
                <li>2016-03-18: Spell level now properly resets on prestige.</li>
                <li>2016-03-18: Added the ability to go to a previous wave.</li>
                <li>2016-03-18: Directly queueable skills now show the time they'll add to the queue before you
                    click on
                    it.
                </li>
                <li>2016-03-17: Fixed bug with prestige resets not clearing the skill display in the skill tree.
                </li>
                <li>2016-03-17: Reduced the base cost for magical affinity from 5 minutes to 2 minutes, to hopefully
                    encourage early interaction with spells.
                </li>
                <li>2016-03-17: The path (purple line) is only recalculated when a block crosses the current line or
                    when a new wave starts, this is to minimize the unnecessary path jumps.
                </li>
                <li>2016-03-16: While writing the instability tooltip I realized that the way instability currently
                    works there were some spells adding runse that would then do no damage on reaction because only
                    elemental towers added instability. Now all elemental damage adds a random portion to
                    instability.
                </li>
                <li>2016-03-16: Active tooltips are now hidden when the currently selected enemy disappears, this is
                    to
                    stop popups from persisting when a boss goes off the edge.
                </li>
                <li>2016-03-16: Instability now has a tooltip.</li>
                <li>2016-03-16: Tentatively declaring the selecting-dead-enemy-bug vanquished.</li>
                <li>2016-03-16: Added Wizardry skill, which increases arcane damage, to lead into things like the
                    mana
                    regen skill below.
                </li>
                <li>2016-03-16: Mana regeneration now shows as a tool tip on the mana bar.</li>
                <li>2016-03-16: Mana regeneration has been changed from a static 0.001% of max mana (which became
                    overpowered at high mana) to start at 1 and be increased by the no-max skill called Mana
                    Regeneration.
                </li>
                <li>2016-03-16: Implemented Arcane Sacrifice, a spell which, if it kills an enemy, will increase the
                    damage and mana cost of all other spells.
                </li>
                <li>2016-03-15: Fixed a bug where loading a save hash would repeat spell slots.</li>
                <li>2016-03-15: Fixed the bug where a reload would refresh the center block, technically allowing an
                    infinite amount of gold generation.
                </li>
                <li>2016-03-14: Fixed mana bugs involving the cursor overlays.</li>
                <li>2016-03-14: Fixed a bug with certain block placements and spawning.</li>
                <li>2016-03-14: Added keybinds q,w,e.. for building blocks and towers and keybinds 1,2,3... for
                    spells.
                    Escape now cancels a cursor.
                </li>
                <li>2016-03-14: Replaced the previous menu with rows of graphical icons.</li>
                <li>2016-03-13: Changed the multi-buy key to SHIFT from CTRL to avoid a bizarre issue that stopped
                    further click evens when CTRL clicking sprites.
                </li>
                <li>2016-03-12: Reduced the growth of block costs.</li>
                <li>2015-12-26: Swarm unit increase nerfed, now produces 3-7 units instead of 5-10.</li>
                <li>2015-12-26: The game now tracks what level of the various boss powers you've seen and tries to
                    limit
                    future boss levels to one increment above what you've already seen. Basically this means if
                    you're
                    at the point where you can receive up to 5 boss powers you shouldn't in one level receive 5x
                    Swarm
                    and then in another receive 5x Regeneration unless you've seen 4x those powers before.
                </li>
                <li>2015-12-26: Powers are only shown when an enemy has powers, if there are multiple powers they
                    are
                    now shown in sorted order with the strongest power first.
                </li>
                <li>2015-12-26: Nerfed the max duration on air towers, now the time that enemies are locked in a
                    wind
                    storm range from 0.5s to 1.5s. I wanted the air towers to be strong but it looked too goofy to
                    have
                    the animation slowly whisk enemies across the map.
                </li>
                <li>2015-12-26: Earth towers now also cause bleed on impact equal to the boulder damage.</li>
                <li>2015-12-26: Cleaned up some code that should make the save hash slightly smaller.</li>
                <li>2015-12-23: Nerfed the reduction rate of bleeding damage but also added a skill called
                    anti-coagulants that reduces this nerf, after 10 ranks it causes bleeding to be increased on
                    tick
                    instead of reduced.
                </li>
                <li>2015-12-20: Added a button to remove individual queue items (if nothing else in the queue
                    depended
                    on them)
                </li>
                <li>2015-12-19: Added a button to clear the queue and a massive nerf to the prestige system, it now
                    only
                    impacts learning rate.
                </li>
                <li>2015-12-18: Prestige system added. Make sure to save your game first.</li>
                <li>2015-12-18: Added several new infinitely expanding skills, there is now at least one in each
                    major
                    skill branch.
                </li>
                <li>2015-12-18: Experimental Change: Skills become twice as effective when you reach rank 20 in
                    them,
                    this repeats for every 20 ranks.
                </li>
                <li>2015-12-16: Added the ability to queue up all of the prerequisites for a given skill.</li>
                <li>2015-12-16: Added some additional checks to the skill queue.</li>
                <li>2015-12-16: Buffed the kinetic tower skill from 1% increase per rank to 5%.</li>
                <li>2015-12-15: Tower range indicators no longer fire when your cursor is loaded.</li>
                <li>2015-12-15: The nerf hammer has been dropped on range. It now suffers diminishing returns.</li>
                <li>2015-12-14: Added the Smolder spell on learning fire affinity.</li>
                <li>2015-12-14: Added the Frost Shatter spell on learning water affinity.</li>
                <li>2015-12-13: Now allows you to cancel spell casting and the various cursors will disappear if you
                    move them off of the screen.
                </li>
                <li>2015-12-13: Added the first spell, mana burst upon learning magical affinity. Spell damage
                    currently
                    scales on the total damage of all your towers.
                </li>
                <li>2015-12-13: Greatly improved how enemies respond to path recalculation.</li>
                <li>2015-12-13: There is now a visual indicator for building towers and blocks.</li>
                <li>2015-12-13: Refactored how cursors work for buying, this is to make way for spells.</li>
                <li>2015-12-13: Holding CTRL now allows you to buy/sell multiple times in a row for towers and
                    blocks.
                </li>
                <li>2015-12-11: Skill labels now update in the tree based on their level.</li>
                <li>2015-12-11: Added skill queueing! Hopefully I resolved all the bugs I introduced by doing this,
                    but
                    probably not.
                </li>
                <li>2015-12-11: Reworked skills UI into a separate dialog box instead of the table.</li>
                <li>2015-12-05: Hopefully the windstorm proc (the somewhat rare chance that an air reaction gets a
                    bonus) should look less nutty now.
                </li>
                <li>2015-12-05: Now hides the menu when your cursor is active (when you're buying a block or
                    tower)
                </li>
                <li>2015-12-05: Implemented yet another experimental UI change, skills are now stored in a
                    filterable
                    paginated table so they don't take a crazy amount of space.
                </li>
                <li>2015-12-04: Implemented an experimental menu UI change.</li>
                <li>2015-12-03: Instead of trying to knockback all enemies as a separate air event which caused
                    weird
                    looking stuff air rune activations now have a chance to produce a storm that captures all
                    enemies.
                </li>
                <li>2015-12-03: All of the elemental towers now do 20% more damage for each rune after the first,
                    e.g.
                    an enemy with 3 water runes that freezes takes instability + 72% additional damage.
                </li>
                <li>2015-12-03: Teleport now selects randomly between tiles that it could jump to instead of picking
                    the
                    one with the best distance.
                </li>
                <li>2015-12-03: Implemented the mana bar, (gained on learning Magical Affinity). Currently you gain
                    0.1%
                    of your max mana a second.
                </li>
                <li>2015-12-02: Massively buffed Refined Blueprints skill (from 1%/rank to 5%/rank).</li>
                <li>2015-12-02: Fixed an issue where the tooltips weren't updating on skill level increase.</li>
                <li>2015-12-01: Fixed the bug where farm/progress mode wasn't being loaded properly.</li>
                <li>2015-11-29: Changed skill descriptions to calculate the current benefit you're getting and the
                    next
                    ranks benefit instead of a static string.
                </li>
                <li>2015-11-29: Changed the skill system from the notion of a skill granting a new skill to the
                    notion
                    of a skill requiring a set of skills. This will allow me to make skills that require multiple
                    prerequisites.
                </li>
                <li>2015-11-29: Added a visual effect to burns caused by the fire runes.</li>
                <li>2015-11-28: Reworked elemental system (yet again), towers now have a chance to attach elemental
                    runes to monsters. Each second each rune has a chance to activate consuming all the runes of the
                    same type and creating an effect of that type. Damage of a given type is increased by 20% for
                    each
                    rune of that type on the target.
                </li>
                <li>2015-11-21: Implemented scrapping skill.</li>
                <li>2015-11-21: Moving back to importing a million javascript files since gulp slows down
                    prototyping so
                    much.
                </li>
                <li>2015-11-20: Added a gulp file for concatenating all the javascript and css files into minified
                    versions. Changed sprite map to JSON which seems to result in fewer errors loading.
                </li>
                <li>2015-11-17: Added a load/save feature.</li>
                <li>2015-11-17: Added a credits screen so I can properly attribute the wonderful folks who jave
                    released
                    free game art that is being used in this project.
                </li>
                <li>2015-11-15: Reworked movement hopefully avoiding the recurrant recovering-from-freezing bugs.
                </li>
                <li>2015-11-14: Removed vex in favor of jQuery UI.</li>
                <li>2015-11-13: Combined the text and the progress bar to save space.</li>
                <li>2015-11-13: Teleport no longer functions when frozen or knocked up (by the air tower).</li>
                <li>2015-11-13: Adjusted nearly all of the skill up times, they were previously set to beta values
                    now
                    it actually takes a few minutes.
                </li>
                <li>2015-11-12: Added farm/progress mode.</li>
                <li>2015-11-12: Changed tooltips to actually work properly.</li>
                <li>2015-11-12: Air tower rework, it now scoops up enemies in a whirlwind and knocks them back far
                    fewer
                    spaces.
                </li>
                <li>2015-11-12: Fixed a bug where the save file would record towers you had already sold, this is
                    probably the cause of folks reporting that their tower damage was much lower after a refersh.
                </li>
                <li>2015-11-08: UI update, made top level buttons for changelog and skills.</li>
                <li>2015-11-08: Reduced the scaling on tower cost increase, reduced the difference in cost from
                    elemental towers to kinetic towers.
                </li>
                <li>2015-11-08: Removed current health percentage damage from elemental damage.</li>
                <li>2015-11-08: Added the upgrades for elemental towers.</li>
                <li>2015-11-07: Added the ability to sell blocks without towers currently on them.</li>
                <li>2015-11-07: Added trace line for the path of the mobs.</li>
                <li>2015-11-04: Added shield power and sprite.</li>
                <li>2015-07-26: Implemented a couple more skills under initial engineering and fixed a layout issue
                    that
                    would prevent clicks on the right side of the game (whoops).
                </li>
                <li>2015-07-24: Made the timing system for background timers more robust.</li>
                <li>2015-07-03: Removed upgrade system and science system and replaced it with time based
                    training.
                </li>
                <li>2015-06-29: BigNumber.js errors mostly abated.</li>
                <li>2015-06-13: Added bignumber.js to allow the total health and gold value of a wave exceed the max
                    javascript value.
                </li>
                <li>2015-06-07: Fire and earth towers are implented. Fire towers cause a slight burn and increase
                    damage
                    from all towers, earth towers drop boulders from the sky and deal AoE damage.
                </li>
                <li>2015-06-07: Air tower is implemented. It knocks back single enemies, when those enemies hit
                    other
                    enemies they take damage.
                </li>
                <li>2015-06-06: Can no longer put a block at 0,0 for obvious reasons.</li>
                <li>2015-06-05: Removed the regular map with the fixed path, added blocks and A* pathing. Towers
                    must
                    now be built on blocks.
                </li>
                <li>2015-06-04: Elemental towers are in, however only the water tower has its effects currently.
                </li>
                <li>2015-06-03: Tower damage is now shown humanized.</li>
                <li>2015-06-03: Boss powers now show on click and have tool tips explaining what they do and how
                    powerful they are.
                </li>
                <li>2015-06-01: Fixed a bug where multi-spawn boss fights weren't clearing after one reached the
                    edge.
                </li>
                <li>2015-06-01: Fixed a bug where one bullet could hit two enemies when spaced close together.</li>
                <li>2015-06-01: Added an event timer that fires every second and refactored regenerating to use
                    it.
                </li>
                <li>2015-05-30: Updated the boss generation to use an an algorithm based on the idea of 'powers'
                    instead
                    of using pre generated boss fights.
                </li>
                <li>2015-05-30: Changed upgrade UI to show random left and right choices instead of a big select
                    box.
                </li>
                <li>2015-05-25: Added floating damage text.</li>
                <li>2015-05-12: Added an upgrade system. For every 5 science levels you can choose to either
                    increase
                    the science bonus of science towers or regular towers. More to come.
                </li>
                <li>2015-05-09: Implemented <b>beta</b> saving feature. It saves the game after the conclusion of
                    each
                    wave.
                </li>
                <li>2015-05-07: Science levels now increase the effectiveness of towers by a percentage (e.g. 44
                    science
                    levels = +44% damage).
                </li>
                <li>2015-05-07: Finally fixed range indicators on towers.</li>
                <li>2015-05-07: Nerfed the amount of range gained on tower upgrade.</li>
                <li>2015-05-07: Added an indicator for the current unit selected (tower or enemy).</li>
                <li>2015-05-07: Added a button to spend all of your gold on upgrades (it does this in the most
                    efficient
                    way possible)..
                </li>
                <li>2015-05-07: Added a dialog box explaining the current functionality of science.</li>
                <li>2015-05-07: Bosses now drop an amount of science equivalent to their wave number.</li>
                <li>2015-05-07: Every 10 levels a towers damage doubles. Made a dialog to explain this.</li>
                <li>2015-05-07: Added an "Upgrade Least Upgraded" button.</li>
                <li>2015-05-07: Made a slight gold penalty (10%) when a regular enemy is allowed to go through the
                    entire path.
                </li>
                <li>2015-05-07: Nerfed the fast dog boss (1.5x speed to 1.3x speed).</li>
                <li>2015-05-07: Boosted gold from killing enemies. Massively nerfed gold from reaching new science
                    levels.
                </li>
                <li>2015-05-07: Fixed a bug where the game loop was looping through all enemies instead of all alive
                    enemies. Woops.
